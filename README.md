# JavaScript Snake

This is a JavaScript game, ported from PHP.

The game uses **WASD** for movements.

The objective of the game is to collect food dots and collect as much points as possible.

During the game, a developer mode can be activated that contains additional testing functionality.

The PHP version of the game can be found [here](https://github.com/joakimwinum/php-snake).
